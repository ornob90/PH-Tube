          Qns1: Discuss the scope of var, let, and const
        </li>

        <li class="ml-5 my-4">
          The scope of var is functional scope, which means it can be accessible
          from anywhere in the code, even if it's declared inside a function. It
          works like a global variable.
          <br />
          On the other hand, let and const are block-scoped, which means the
          variables declared with let or const are only accessible inside the
          scope where they are declared.
        </li>

        <li class="font-bold text-2xl">
          Qns2: Tell us the use cases of null and undefined
        </li>

        <li class="ml-5 my-4">
          Undefine means the variable has been declared but no value has been
          assinged to it yet
          <br />
          Where null means a null value is assinged to a variable
        </li>

        <li class="font-bold text-2xl">Qns3: What do you mean by REST API?</li>
        <li class="ml-5 my-4">
          A REST API, or Application Programming Interface, refers to a set of
          rules used to connect the frontend to the backend or to connect
          different apps created using various languages. It can be used to
          access data from a backend. Many websites store their data in JSON
          format, which can be accessed via an API.
